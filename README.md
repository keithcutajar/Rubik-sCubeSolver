# Rubik-sCubeSolver
This was an assignment  in the Higher National Diploma. It consists of having a solved Rubik's cube. You can change the faces to make it not solved and then you chose either the BellmanFord or the Dijkstra algorithm and the program gives you an output with the shortest rotations that need to be done in order to solve the cube again/
